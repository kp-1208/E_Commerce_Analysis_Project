# E_Commerce_Analysis_Project
Hello!
Great to see you!

1. To smoothly use this project on your PC, kindly follow some steps:
   -> Download and store the dataset (.csv) file in the same folder as of the project.
   -> If not, make sure that you modify the code and paste the full  path of the dataset (.csv) file.
   -> Make sure you have pandas and numpy installed.

2. To smoothly use this project on your own dataset:
   -> Make sure number of columns and their names remain same.
   -> You can modify the data and provide own data. 

Kindly give a feedback/suggestions if any.

Would be great if someone designs a good GUI for this project with buttons and similar screen wait,
and clear screen instances!
